    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <p>Shakyam is a filmmaker and producer. He's also terrorzided by the future, often feels alone and looses interest easily when thing don't go according to plan. Conditionned within the North-American's definition of success, his work often fall pray to his foolish and deterministic vision of life that focuses on the end rather than the way to get there (although his Buddhist roots are always creeping around the corner of mind, urging him to shut the little voices and be present) . Mais, "Es Mus Sein!", "The end justifies the mean", "Be courageous!" are his daily mantras. He knows that when he's in the zone, nothing can stop him from pouring his whole heart onto the world or a task that he judges self-sufficient and trully meaningful within the boundaries of his subjective reality.</p>
